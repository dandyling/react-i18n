# react-i18n

An tiny, I18N library for React JS. It makes use of the `Context API` to support a hierarchy of language bundles (each of which can be loaded on demand) and the native `Intl` package to provide some formatting utilities for common things like dates and currencies. You can include anything else as and when you need it.
